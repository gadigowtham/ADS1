The media may not be successful in telling people what to think but undoubtedly they are successfully telling their audience what to think about. The media cannot force anyone to believe in something but they are influencing our ideas.

Suppose let’s take an example of how teleshopping is done on television. The advertisement of a belt which has to be tied on stomach and waist 24 hours can reduce your weight. In the advertisement they clearly say and even show that running and exercises can’t make you slim and fit and that if you want to look slim and smarter you must use that belt 24 hours and no need to do any exercises daily. The question here is that they don’t even mention once that how good running or exercising is for healthy life rather than using the belt. Many people start thinking in that way and their lifestyle etc. is determined by their media friends only. 


 It’s media which has made it necessary for us to have our toothpaste with salt, mint etc. as if you are going to eat it.

It’s the media , social media , which has forced us think of count of friends on facebook and not the number of real friends on which we can count upon.

No one can deny the fact that in 2014 General elections of India it was the media which took Modi to every corner of the country. 

And its the media which made a cinestar a mass leader and some were made “Pappu” by the same media itself who still carry the same image in public.

Thus,The media doesnt controls how and what we think but definetely it influences our ideas and the way of our thinking.
